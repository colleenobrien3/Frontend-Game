#FrontEnd Trivia Game
For this project, we were tasked with creating a game that can be played in the browser. I built a page using HTML and CSS that hosts a trivia game. I used JavaScript to give the game functionality. 
##Getting Started
Once the page has loaded, use the navigation bar at the left to progress through the questions, choosing an answer for each. At the end of the game, submit the answers. The game will check your answers against the correct answers, and give you your score. You will then  be given the option of either trying again or seeing the correct answers.
